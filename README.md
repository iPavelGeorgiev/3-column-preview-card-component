## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this 3-column card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### What I learned

I learned a new technique for creating buttons with transparent text using the mix-blend-mode property. I also found a very useful extension called 'Perfect Pixels' that helps you develop your projects with pixel-perfect accuracy!
